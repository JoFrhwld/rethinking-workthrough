I've set up the blog using the default quarto blog template in RStudio, also initializing a git repo and renv.

```{r}
#| eval: false
renv::install(c("tidyverse", "brms"))
renv::install(c("coda", "mvtnorm", "dagitty"))
```

The preface wants to install the book package with `devtooks::install_github()`, but I'm pretty sure that's been superseded with `remotes::install_github()`, and `renv::install()`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
renv::install("rmcelreath/rethinking")
```
